## 📌 Description

This project was created to reinforce core JavaScript concepts by building a functional card game. It demonstrates how to:

* Use functions and control flow
* Generate random card values
* Track game state using variables and objects
* Dynamically update the DOM

---

## 🔧 How It Works

* **Start Game**: Deals two random cards and starts a new round.
* **New Card**: Draws an additional card if the player hasn’t busted or hit Blackjack.
* Cards are displayed along with the total sum.
* The game provides live feedback based on the current total:

  * Under 21: Prompt to draw a new card
  * Exactly 21: Declare Blackjack!
  * Over 21: Player busts and loses
